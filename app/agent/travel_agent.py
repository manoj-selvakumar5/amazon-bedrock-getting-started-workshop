The same two capabilities as the Lambda version, turned into tools: search_policy answers
questions from the travel policy, and check_expense checks expense items against it. The model
decides which tools to call, and in what order.

Used two ways: imported by the stretch notebook to run the agent locally, and deployed to
Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime by main.py.
